## Analysis 

This analysis looks at the utilization of CitiBike in NYC during the month of July in 2023, to get more information on usage during the peak of summer when utilization is likely to be high. 

### Members vs Casual Users
The analysis shows that the bulk of CitiBike users are Members (68.80%) vs Casual Users (31.20%). While Members are clearly the majority, further analysis could be done on converting more Casual Users to Members.

### Rideable Type Popularity
We also looked at the popularity of the different rideable types CitiBike offers. The classic bike was far and away the most popular, with 95,055 total trips. Members made up 66,772 of the total, Casual Users 28,283. Electric bikes had 11,338 total trips, with Members making up 6.572 of the total, Casual Users 4,766. docked bikes had a mere 215 total trips. 

Additional data would be helpful here to determine suggestions for action. Are electric bikes and docked bikes less utilized because they aren't as popular, or is it because fewer of them are available to begin with? This information would help determine if CitiBike should consider phasing them out, or replacing them with classic bikes. 

### Most Popular Trip Start Times
Over all users, utilization was the highest from 5pm to 7pm, with 6pm being the most popular trip start time among both Members and Casual Users. 

The increase in activity at these times may be due to users utilizing the bikes to run errands or attend events after work. It could also be due to the temperature cooling off, making biking a more attractive option than earlier in the day.
